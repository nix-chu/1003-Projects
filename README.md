# 1003-Projects
*Projects from ENG Engineering Mobile Apps class*

The following are the projects created during this class. This repository will be used as a reference for myself for future projects. This will also be used to store past scripts and code to apply new knowledge or reflect what could be improved.

This class was a first-year entry class to Software Engineering, which introduced me to Information Technology and Computer Science for the first time. Topics covered include; Coding Basics & Syntax, Debugging, Git, API, User Interface, Web Services. Class was taught using Javascript, HTML and CSS. All projects were done in a small team assigned by the teaching staff. 

If you have not noticed, I am refraining from referring to the actual unit code for the class to prevent students from plagarising code. If you are a student of this class, congratulations for finding this repository. However, I am not liable for any penalties incurred due to plagarism, nor any marks lost due to different assignments/prac requirements.
